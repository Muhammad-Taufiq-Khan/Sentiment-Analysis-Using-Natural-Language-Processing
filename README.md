# US-Airline-Passenger-s-Sentiment-Analysis-IEEE-Conference-

• Developed 6 different Machine Learning models to predict passenger sentiment from the ’US Airline Sentiment’ dataset.
• Applied BoW and TF‑IDF techniques of NLP.
• Written a conference paper (Accepted in IEEE ICECIT 2021) on applied methods.

(NB: Project will be updated in GitHub with the Clean Code, Full Readme, Tutorial Article, and Presentation Video after publication. Maybe in October 2021)

Methodology:
1. Data Collection: Collected Imbalenced, Multiclass, large data from Kaggle. Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment . 
2. Pre-processing: Removing punctuations, Numbers, Symbols. Converting each charecter into lowercase. Tokenizing and Lemmatizing.
4. Vectorization: Vectoring texual data with BoW and TF-IDF.
5. ML Classification Algorithms: Applied SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression.
6. Evaluation: Evaluated with Accuracy, Precission, Recall, F1-Score metrices.
